<h3> 👋 Hi there, I’m Jenny, a PHP/Symfony junior developer based in Paris. </h3>
 <p>👀 I will finish my PHP/Symfony course with OpenClassroom in May,2022. I am seeking an opportunity as a web developer where I can use my problem-solving skills to grow and expand an organization as well as myself.</p>
 <p>🌱 As my 'official 'study with OpenClassroom is coming to an end, I'm currently building my Portfolio.  I am using Symfony framework, of course, and I am also making the most of the project to learn Docker,  EasyAdminBundle bundle, and reinforce my jQuery skills.</p>
 <p>💞️ I’m looking for my first web developer job and am also open to any fun and challenging projects to develop new skills! </p>
<p> 📫 Feel free to reach me :<br><br>
