<h3> 👋 Hi there, I’m Jenny, a PHP/Symfony junior developer based in Paris. </h3>
 <p>👀 I will finish my PHP/Symfony course with OpenClassroom in May,2022. I am seeking an opportunity as a web developer where I can use my problem-solving skills to grow and expand an organization as well as myself.</p>
 <p>🌱 As my 'official 'study with OpenClassroom is coming to an end, I'm currently exploring myself in various projects.  I have just built my portfolio using Symfony framework, Docker,  EasyAdminBundle bundle and jQuery. I have also self-learned Laravel and have built a user management system in Laravel. I will now have a deep look into mirco service and learn a frontend Framework (vue.js or React js? any thought?)</p>
 <p>💞️ I’m looking for my first web developer job , idealy starting in September but technically I can start anytimes and am also open to any fun and challenging projects to develop new skills!  </p>
<p> 📫 Feel free to reach me :<br><br>
